### Spotify Music Recommendation 

This web app is built as a hobby, to get more familiar with VueJS and Spotify API.  
If you want to download it, check it out or build on it, then keep in mind that for it to work you need to edit file in server/config/config.json.template.  
Add your Spotify API keys and remove the .template file extension.
For development use:  
```console
npm run server   //This will run the development VueJS server
node index.js    //This will run the server
```
Once done, go to: http://localhost:8888/login
